CouchDB is a document-based embedded database. It's designed to syncrhonize data when the user comes back online.

It is primarily used to store JSON objects, but can also store binary attachments such as images.

One of the primary characteristics of couchdb is the ability to run it as a single node, or as a clustered system.
